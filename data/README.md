# Raw Data

Raw data contains data which isn't created by writing code. Other raw data is
avalible in the scrapers folder.

# Intermediate Data

This is data created by scripts and saved here.

# Historical Data

The cleanest version of the data is stored here every time a new scrape is run.
This allows examination of how the data has changed through time.

# Clean Data

Two datasets are in clean data. The first is "covid_deaths_full.csv". Here we 
have all possible variables. The purpose of this dataset is to allow checking 
and  validation of the data. Some of the variables may also be useful for 
analysis.

The second is "covid_deaths.csv", this is a simplier version designed for 
analysts to use.
